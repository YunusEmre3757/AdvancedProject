# Brand Feature Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of brand filtering in the e-commerce application.

## Overview

The brand feature allows users to filter products by their brand, enhancing the product search and filtering capabilities. This implementation includes:

1. Backend changes to support brand storage, retrieval, and filtering
2. Migration script to add brand data to existing products
3. API endpoints to support brand-related operations

## Database Changes

1. Added `brand` column to the `products` table
2. Created a migration script (`V1.3__add_brand_to_products.sql`) to add the column and populate existing products with sample brand data

## Model Changes

1. Added `brand` field to the `Product` entity
2. Added constructor in the `Product` class that includes the brand field
3. Updated the `updateProduct` method in `ProductService` to handle brand updates

## Repository Changes

1. Added methods to the `ProductRepository` interface:
   - `findByBrandIgnoreCaseAndActive`: To find products by brand (case-insensitive)
   - `findAllBrands`: To retrieve a list of all unique brands

## Service Changes

1. Updated the `getProducts` method in `ProductService` to handle brand filtering using JPA Criteria API
2. Added `getAllBrands` method to retrieve all unique brands from the database

## Controller Changes

1. Updated the product endpoint to accept a `brand` parameter
2. Added a new endpoint `/api/products/brands` to retrieve all available brands

## API Endpoints

1. `GET /api/products?brand={brandName}`: Get products filtered by brand
2. `GET /api/products/brands`: Get a list of all brands

## Frontend Integration

The Angular frontend already has the code to support brand filtering:

1. The `ProductService` in Angular has methods to get brands and filter products by brand
2. The UI components can use these methods to display and filter by brands

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. Run the migration script to add the brand column and populate data
2. Call the brands endpoint to verify the brands are retrieved correctly
3. Filter products by brand to verify the filtering works correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Add brand counts (number of products per brand) to the brands endpoint
2. Add UI components for brand filtering (checkboxes, dropdowns)
3. Implement brand management in the admin panel
